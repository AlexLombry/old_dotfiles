# Alex Lombry dot files

These are my config files to set up my system.

I also had a lot of aliases. You might like some of them.

## Installation

  git clone git://github.com/AlexLombry/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
  
  cd ~/dotfiles
  
  chmod +x install.sh
  
  ./install.sh

  My Vim plugins are actually managed with Vundle.
  
  Run :PluginInstall in vim or launch vim with : vim +PluginInstall +qall
